# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models. Businesses can use these insights to retain customers by identifying at-risk users.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
- SQL (for data extraction)
- Tableau (for visualization)

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer information such as:
- **Demographics** – Age, Gender
- **Subscription Details** – Contract type, Payment Method
- **Service Usage** – Monthly Charges, Total Charges
- **Churn (Target Variable)** – 1 if the customer left, 0 otherwise

## Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and categorical encoding.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created new variables for churn analysis.
3. **Model Training:** Used **Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost**.
4. **Evaluation:** Achieved **85% accuracy** in predicting churn.
5. **Visualization:** Used Tableau dashboards to present key churn drivers.

## Results
- Identified top churn predictors (e.g., contract type, payment method).
- Helped businesses take proactive actions to retain customers.
- Reduced customer churn by **15%** through targeted marketing strategies.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning (LSTMs) for better predictions.
- Deploy as a real-time prediction model for customer service teams.
